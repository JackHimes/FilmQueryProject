# FilmQueryProject

## Description
This program allows the user to find information about movies, in a database, by searching certain criteria. The program starts by displaying a menu where the user can select from three options. When selected, the first option allows the user to look up a film by its film ID. The film with the matching ID is displayed with information from the database, such as year released, rating, description, etc. The program continues by displaying the menu again. If the user selects the second option, they are prompted to type in a keyword that might match in the movie title or in its description. All films that have this keyword will be displayed, similar to the first options display, however if multiple films match this criteria, they are all displayed. The menu is then displayed again. If the user chooses the third option, they will exit the program. Future directions for this program are to add additional pieces of data from different tables in the database to the films info display and implement JUnit tests to verify the validity of the search.

## What I learned
As the first project introducing JDBC, there was a lot to learn to accomplish this project. The first aspect from this project that I learned was how to write proper SQL queries. This includes being able to find pieces of data across multiple tables in the database. The next aspect I learned was how to connect the Java program to the SQL database. Through this connection, I learned how to convert the SQL data into Java objects. Additionally, the use of prepared statements and bind variables which allowed for custom searches was a new concept I utilized. Some tools I was familiarized with are Maven(pom.xml) and MAMP. This project also greatly improved my understanding of OOP principles, such as creating the film and actor classes and using the data from the database to create objects from these classes. Overall, I'm excited to learn more about connecting back-end with other sources.
